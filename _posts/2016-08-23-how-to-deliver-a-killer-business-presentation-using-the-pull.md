  Sadly, far too many people shroud the business presentation in mystery. They
  seem to either follow some haphazard, disconnected process for writing and
  shaping the message they want to communicate or they follow an outdated
  'start-from-the-top-and-just-follow-your-nose' method. There's no mystery to
  becoming a powerful, memorable business presenter.
